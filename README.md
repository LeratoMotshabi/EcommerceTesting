# EcommerceTesting

This project demonstrates eCommerce application testing. 
The project showcases my understanding of Selenium WebDriver with java and data-driven using data provider.
It is integrated with extent reports and allure reports and it takes a screenshot of all the failed test cases and then sends a test report via email after running all test cases. 
The project tests feature like sorting, checking the availability of products, price verification, ordering of product, and more.
